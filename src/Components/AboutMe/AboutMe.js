            <h1>Hello,</h1><br />
            <p>I am a self taught beginner front-end web developer, who is looking for 
                work experience. Since the start of February I have begun independent lessons
                at Codecademy. As a result, I have improved my knowledge 
                in HTML, CSS and learned JavaScript, GitHub and React. To show off what 
                I have learned, I made this CV-website from scratch with React, where I 
                share my work experience, skills and projects.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
            <p>If these lessons taught me anything, is that there are still too many 
                    things for me to learn. Therefore, I know that I don't have enough 
                    knowledge or experience to ask for a proper job position. However, 
                    I am looking for an internship, where I could start building a solid 
                    career path at web development. I am eager to learn, improve and gain 
                    invaluable work experience. I thank you for your time, for reading 
                    this and I eagerly await your answer.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
