            <h1>Hello,</h1><br />
            <p>My name is Lukas, I am 24 years old and I have recently started learning web 
                development. Throughout my career, I have tried a few different activities 
                like video editing, content writing or marketing. Due to either personal 
                disinterest or lack of career opportunities, none of these activities have 
                stuck with me for long. And since the IT business is always growing and I 
                have heard several success stories in there, I have decided to hopefully 
                start a new and successful career path in web development myself.</p><br /><br /><br />
            <p>Since the start of February I have begun independent lessons at Codecademy. 
                I have chosen the path of front-end web developer, since we were tought some
                 basics at university and they were quite appealing. Throughout the month 
                 and some more, I have improved my knowledge in HTML, CSS and learned 
                 JavaScript, GitHub and React. To show off what I have learned, I made 
                 this CV-website from scratch with React, where I share my work experience, 
                 skills and projects, which, in truth, are just some of the Codecademy tasks.</p><br /><br /><br />
                <p>If these lessons taught me anything, is that there are still too many 
                    things for me to learn. Therefore, I know that I don't have enough 
                    knowledge or experience to ask for a proper job position. However, 
                    I am looking for an internship, where I could start building a solid 
                    career path at web development. I am eager to learn, improve and gain 
                    invaluable work experience. I thank you for your time, for reading 
                    this and I eagerly await your answer. I also understand that this is 
                    not a good time to look for internship, but I prefer to try at least.</p><br /><br /><br />
